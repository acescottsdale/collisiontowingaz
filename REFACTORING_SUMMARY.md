# Cost Calculator Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the CostCalculator component into smaller, more maintainable components and implemented a complete quote submission system using Resend.

## Key Changes

### 1. Component Structure Refactored
The monolithic CostCalculator component has been broken down into:

- **`types.ts`** - Type definitions for all shared interfaces
- **`constants.ts`** - All pricing constants and utility functions
- **`utils.ts`** - Utility functions for geolocation, geocoding, and distance calculation
- **`VehicleForm.tsx`** - Handles vehicle information input
- **`ServiceSelector.tsx`** - Service type selection component
- **`LocationForm.tsx`** - Location input and distance calculation
- **`DiscountForm.tsx`** - Veteran and student discount selection
- **`CostSummary.tsx`** - Cost breakdown display
- **`EnhancedQuoteModal.tsx`** - Enhanced quote submission modal

### 2. Enhanced Quote System

- **Form validation** ensures all required fields are completed
- **GPS location sharing** option for customers
- **Real-time cost calculation** based on service type and vehicle size
- **Professional email templates** for both business notifications and customer confirmations

### 3. API Implementation (`/api/quote`)
- **Full validation** using Zod schema
- **Business notification emails** with detailed quote information
- **Customer confirmation emails** (optional, if email provided)
- **Professional HTML email templates** with branding

## Required Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your environment:

## Usage Flow
1. Customer selects service type
2. Customer enters vehicle information
3. Customer enters pickup and destination addresses
4. Customer clicks "Calculate" to get distance (**required step**)
5. Customer can apply discounts if eligible
6. Customer clicks "Confirm Quote" (only enabled after distance calculation)
7. Customer fills out contact information in modal
8. Customer can optionally share GPS location
9. System sends emails to both business and customer
10. Customer receives confirmation of quote submission

## Benefits
- **Better maintainability** - Smaller, focused components
- **Improved user experience** - Clear validation and feedback
- **Professional communication** - Branded email templates
- **Better data collection** - All necessary information captured
